# Palindrome Check
In this assignment, you'll design and implement one of the string manipulation functions that is commonly asked during interviews.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on restricted arrays will work on strings as well.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method that checks if the input string is a palindrome. The method should return true if the input string is a palindrome, and return false if it is not a palindrome. Do not alter the input string.
* Try to think of a solution that optimizes the space complexity as much as possible. In other words, check if your algorithm can avoid duplicating the original string.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution.
* At minimum, your implementation should pass the basic tests.

**Note 1**: Palindrome is a word, phrase or sentence that reads the same backwards as it does forwards. e.g. "madam"

**Note 2**: Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`. You may use `.length`.
